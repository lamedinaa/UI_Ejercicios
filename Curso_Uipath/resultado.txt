LESSON 2 – VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES - RECAPThis lesson introduced you to the overall UiPath Studio interface and the way to add Activities to your project. 
You learnt about manipulating variables and how Sequence and Flowchart work.
OverviewTakeaways
Make sure you use explicit names for your Activities.
Main types of variables are: integer, string, datetime, boolean, generic, array of …
Generic variables can hold any type of data.
.
Renaming a variable in the variables pane propagates the changes throughout your 
project.
Any variable has a scope which defines its lifetime.
You used these activities: MessageBox and Assign.
There are 2 ways of organizing the performed actions – Sequence for short and simple 
workflows, and Flowchart for more complex workflows and high level organisation.
UiPath Studio has 3 main areas – Activities panel, Workflow designer and Properties 
panel.Best practices
It’s very important to use relevant names for your Activities.
Sequences are better suited for simple and small scenarios where the Activities
follow each other. They are the preferred layout for most workflows.
Flowcharts are best when you need to showcase decision points within a process and 
they offer higher flexibility regarding the connections between Activities.Managing Variables
